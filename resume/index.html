<h2 id="most-recent-position">Most recent Position</h2>

<p>Worked at AppOrbit on the AppSwitch project.  From the project documentation:</p>

<pre><code>AppSwitch performs service discovery, access control and traffic management
functions on behalf of the applications by transparently taking over the
applications network API calls. 
</code></pre>

<p>Role involved writing Golang and C (kernel space and user space).  AppSwitch
includes a Linux kernel driver to intercept system calls and also provides the
same functionality in user space using BPF.</p>

<p>Testing done in Python, Bash, C, and Golang.  Was responsible for writing and
maintaining end to end tests (written in Python and shell) utilising docker in
docker.</p>

<h2 id="open-source-experience">Open Source Experience</h2>

<p>Open source contributions made to the following projects, among others:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=grep&amp;q=me%40tobin.cc">Linux Kernel</a>
(C ).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3Atcharding+zfs+">ZFS</a> (C ).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3Atcharding+kubernetes+">Kubernetes</a> (Go)</li>
<li>Mystereum (blockchain, Go).</li>
<li>Gonum graph library (Go).</li>
<li>OpenBazaar-Server (Python).</li>
<li>Guile Scheme (Scheme, C).</li>
<li>Binutils, GNU Assembler (Documentation).</li>
</ul>

<p>Work on the Linux kernel, primarily the Kernel Self Protection Project and
netdev. Also interested in filesystems, networking, device drivers and
security. Current Linux kernel maintainer of the leaking_addresses.pl script.</p>

<p>Previously worked on layer 2 networking code within the Linux kernel. Focus on
the KS7010 Wi-Fi driver (drivers/staging/ks7010).  Also some Power PC work.
While resolving Power PC kernel issues contributed documentation patches to the
GNU Assembler, as well as an assembly code patch series within the kernel
PowerPC code.  Minor bug fixes and clean up patches to the Power PC tree as well
as trivial cleanup patches into the kernel core (net, purgatory, mm).</p>

<p>While studying data structures and algorithms contributed code, and design test
implementation, to the Gonum graph library written in Golang.  Utilized graph
library as reference while implementing solutions to graph problems on
HackerRank.</p>

<p>Contributed to the Free Software Foundation Guile project.  Interacted with
Guile community via public mailing list.  Iterated multiple revisions in order
to assimilate a personal fix into a patch that was acceptable by the community.
Produced a solution to a known outstanding issue requiring a multi-language
patch set in C and Scheme.</p>

<p>Two months focused work on OpenBazaar Server code in Python.  First non-company
contributor to the project.  Most patches were unit testing and code
refactoring.  Some work on the command line interface and interoperability
between operating systems.</p>

 <a href="https://github.com/tcharding/work-logs">Logged</a> hours and topics
worked.  Topics include; computer architecture,
programming languages and theory, operating systems, data structures
and algorithms, professional software development methodology and practices.  See
below ‘code written in last 12 months’ and
<a href="http://tobin.cc/reading-list">~/books</a>.  Text highlights include;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Art of Computer Programming</strong> (volumes 1 and 2) Donald E. Knuth</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</strong> W. Richard Stevens, Stephen A. Rag</li>

Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman</li>
<li><strong>Applied Cryptography</strong> Bruce Schneier</li>
<li><strong>Clean Code, A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</strong> Robert C. Martin</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/tcharding/self_learning">Github</a> repository for code
written during apprenticeship.  All code worked on is open source unless
explicitly requested otherwise (i.e Project Euler, Eudyptula Challenge).</p>
